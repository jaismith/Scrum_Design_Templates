# Design & Implementation Documentation

*Design and Implementation documentation is a great way to keep your team in sync, and a great way to ensure project components work well together. Although writing them can feel tedious, the time you spend here will save you far more down the road (when your modules interface efficiently and effectively with rest of the team's work).*

## Documents

### [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)

*Start here! This document contains a fleshed out explanation of how your project will be structured. What features it will have? How users will interact with it? How is the project organized? If there are modules, what are they?*

### [IMPLEMENTATION.md](IMPLEMENTATION.md)

*This document is a detailed explanation of how you will execute on everything you wrote in your DESIGN document. This is where the psuedocode for all the modules you previously wrote about goes! This document tends to be signicantly longer than DESIGN (ideally all your explanations here should be easily translatable into code).*

## Scrum

*The scrum work model generally accompanies the above documentation style. It aims to keep members of development teams in sync through frequent check-in meetings and a thorough, collaborative design process. The classic scrum model consists of **weekly sprints** for which concrete goals are set, and includes a **daily 15 minute meeting** in which members of the development team share their progress and plan for the remainder of each sprint. At the end of each sprint, the team **reviews both completed and not-completed work**, and presents only the completed work to shareholders.*

*A far more detailed description of the Scrum project-management workflow can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), or by googling '[Scrum Methodology](https://www.google.com/search?q=Scrum+Methodology)'.*
